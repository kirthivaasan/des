    var wiki_articles = ["The Data Encryption Standard (DES, /ˌdiːˌiːˈɛs/ or /ˈdɛz/) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. Although now considered insecure, it was highly influential in the advancement of modern cryptography.Developed in the early 1970s at IBM and based on an earlier design by Horst Feistel, the algorithm was submitted to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) following the agency's invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government data. In 1976, after consultation with the National Security Agency (NSA), the NBS eventually selected a slightly modified version (strengthened against differential cryptanalysis, but weakened against brute force attacks), which was published as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1977.The publication of an NSA-approved encryption standard simultaneously resulted in its quick international adoption and widespread academic scrutiny. Controversies arose out of classified design elements, a relatively short key length of the symmetric-key block cipher design, and the involvement of the NSA, nourishing suspicions about a backdoor. The intense academic scrutiny the algorithm received over time led to the modern understanding of block ciphers and their cryptanalysis.DES is now considered to be insecure for many applications. This is mainly due to the 56-bit key size being too small; in January 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes (see chronology). There are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are infeasible to mount in practice. The algorithm is believed to be practically secure in the form of Triple DES, although there are theoretical attacks. The cipher has been superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Furthermore, DES has been withdrawn as a standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.Some documentation makes a distinction between DES as a standard and DES as an algorithm, referring to the algorithm as the DEA (Data Encryption Algorithm)."
    ,"The 2017 Spanish constitutional crisis[7] is an ongoing political conflict between the Government of Spain and the Generalitat of Catalonia over the issue of the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, starting after the law intending to allow such a referendum was denounced by the Spanish government under Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and subsequently suspended by the Constitutional Court until it ruled on the issue.[8][9] The Catalan government under President Carles Puigdemont announced that neither central Spanish authorities nor the courts would halt their plans and that it intended to hold the vote anyway, sparking a legal backlash that quickly spread from the Spanish and Catalan governments to Catalan municipalities—as local mayors were urged by the Generalitat to provide logistical support and help for the electoral process to be carried out—as well as to the Constitutional Court, the High Court of Justice of Catalonia and state prosecutors.[8][10][11]By 15 September, as pro–Catalan independence parties began their referendum campaigns, the Spanish government had launched an all-out legal offensive to thwart the 1 October vote, including threats of a financial takeover of much of the Catalan budget, police seizing pro-referendum posters, pamphlets and leaflets which had been regarded as illegal and criminal investigations ordered on the over 700 local mayors who had publicly agreed to help stage the referendum.[12][13] Tensions between the two sides reached a critical point after Spanish police raided the Catalan government headquarters in Barcelona on 20 September, at the start of Operation Anubis, and arrested 13 senior Catalan officials, with some international media describing the events as \"one of the worst political crises in modern Spanish history\".[14]"
    , "On 6 September 2017, the ruling Junts pel Sí (JxSí) coalition and its parliamentary partner, the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), passed a controversial law—the Law on a Self-determination Referendum on the Independence of Catalonia—in the Parliament of Catalonia that was to provide the legal framework for the intended independence referendum scheduled for 1 October. The way in which the law had been pushed through Parliament also became an issue of controversy. Catalan opposition parties accused JxSí and CUP of fast-tracking the law through parliament by altering the day's agenda to introduce the issue, violating their parliamentary rights by skipping legally-required steps for bills to go through before being put up to vote. Members from JxSí acknowledged it was not their preferred method, but justified it in that it was the only way to get the bill on the floor without being blocked and that it was not \"any ordinary law\". Shortly after the parliamentary vote, in which most of the opposition MPs walked out from the chamber without voting the bill, the Catalan regional government signed the decree calling for the 1 October referendum.[23][24]The People's Party-led Spanish government under Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced that it would appeal the bill to the Constitutional Court, which agreed to hear all four of its unconstitutionality appeals and subsequently suspended the law and the referendum until it was to rule upon the matter. Despite the referendum suspension, the Catalan government announced it would anyway proceed with the vote.[25][26] This prompted Attorney General José Manuel Maza to ask security forces to investigate on possible preparations from the Catalan government to hold the vote, as well as announcing he would present criminal charges against members of both the regional parliament and government for voting and signing off the referendum. The national government proceeded to deploy a series of legal measures intended to nullify the referendum, while also warning local councils in Catalonia to either impede or paralyse efforts to carry out the vote.[8][23] Previously, local mayors had been given 48 hours by the regional government to confirm the availability of polling stations for 1 October.[27][28] On 7 September and under a similar procedure as the day previously, pro-independence lawmakers in the Parliament of Catalonia passed the legal framework that was to prevail the Spanish one should a majority vote for the 'Yes' to independence choice.[25]Within the next two days, nearly 74% of Catalan municipalities—comprising about 43% of the Catalan population—had agreed to provide the needed polling stations for the referendum, whereas many of the most-populated urban areas—representing 24% of Catalan inhabitants—had voiced their opposition to the vote.[29] The largest city and capital of Catalonia, Barcelona—accounting for about 20% of the region's population—was caught in the middle, with its local mayor, Ada Colau, refusing to make a statement whether the municipality would provide logistic support to the referendum or not while rejecting putting public servants at risk; she, however, voiced her support for the people's right to vote in a fair and legal referendum.[30][31] Concurrently, President of Catalonia Carles Puigdemont, Vice President Oriol Junqueras, the entire Catalan government as well as parliamentary officials allowing the referendum law to be put to vote in Parliament—including Parliament Speaker Carme Forcadell—faced charges of disobedience, misusing public funds and making deliberately unlawful decisions as elected officials as the High Court of Justice of Catalonia agreed to hear the criminal complaints filled by state prosecutors."
    , "The regional Government of Catalonia held a referendum on Catalan independence on 1 October 2017.[1] This referendum was first called for in June 2017 and was approved by the Catalan parliament in a session on 6 September 2017 along with a law which states that independence would be binding with a simple majority, without requiring a minimum turnout.[2] Opposition parties refused to participate in the session and called on their voters to boycott the vote, except Catalunya Sí que es Pot who abstained but supports participation.[3] The law is illegal according to the Catalan Statutes of autonomy which require a two third majority in the Catalan parliament for any change to Catalonia's status.[4] The referendum itself is also illegal according to the Spanish constitution.[5] It was suspended by the Constitutional Court on 7 September 2017, with the Catalan government stating the court order was not valid for Catalonia and proceeding to gather the support of 750[6] of 948 municipalities of Catalonia,[7][8][9] including a partial support by Barcelona.[10] This led to a constitutional crisis in Spain and started a police operation to stop the referendum. The referendum question, which voters answered with \"Yes\" or \"No\", was \"Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic?\". The \"Yes\" side won, with 2,020,144 (91.96%) voting for independence and 176,565 (8.04%) voting against, with the turnout being 42.34%.The Government of Spain opposes any Catalan self-determination referendum,[11][12] because the Spanish Constitution does not allow for a vote on the independence of any Spanish region while also deeming it illegal without its consent.[13][14] This interpretation is also favoured by the Catalan Statutory Guarantees Council.[15] However, the Catalan government invoked the right to self-determination for calling the referendum.Following a constitutionality check demanded by the Spanish government, the Constitutional Court of Spain annulled the resolution emanated by the Parliament of Catalonia to hold such a vote.[16] The Government of Catalonia, though, maintained that the vote would still be held on 1 October.[1] To avoid the Spanish governments influence, the Catalan government passed a referendum law through its own parliament, by simple majority, in September[17] declaring that it would then follow a \"Catalan-only\" legality (as opposed to the general Spanish one). Spain's deputy prime minister, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, notified the Catalan government in advance that the state would strike down the referendum law right after it was passed.[17]On the day of the poll, the passivity of the Mossos d'Esquadra (the autonomous police force of Catalonia) prevented the closure of the polling stations, which caused the intervention of the National Police Corps and the Guardia Civil;[18][19] 893 civilians and 39 agents of the Nacional Police and the Guardia Civil were injured.[20][19][21] The Mossos d'Esquadra are being investigated for a delict of civil disobedience, for not having complied with the orders of the High Court of Justice of Catalonia to prevent the referendum.[22] The Spanish government under the guide of Mariano Rajoy has come under international scrutiny over its use of force on civilians to prevent the referendum.[23][24][25][26][27]"
    , "Germany uses the mixed-member proportional representation system, a system of proportional representation combined with elements of first-past-the-post voting. The Bundestag has 598 nominal members, elected for a four-year term; these seats are distributed between the sixteen German states in proportion to the states' population eligible to vote.Every elector has two votes: a constituency and a list vote. 299 members are elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post, based just on the first votes. The second votes are used to produce an overall proportional result in the states and then in the Bundestag. Seats are allocated using the Sainte-Laguë method. If a party wins fewer constituency seats in a state than its second votes would entitle it to, it receives additional seats from the relevant state list. Parties can file lists in each single state under certain conditions; for example, a fixed number of supporting signatures. Parties can receive second votes only in those states in which they have successfully filed a state list.If a party by winning single-member constituencies in one state receives more seats than it would be entitled to according to its second vote share in that state (so-called overhang seats), the other parties receive compensation seats. Owing to this provision, the Bundestag usually has more than 598 members. The 18th and current Bundestag, for example, started with 631 seats: 598 regular and 33 overhang and compensation seats. Overhang seats are calculated at the state level, so many more seats are added to balance this out among the different states, adding more seats than would be needed to compensate for overhang at the national level in order to avoid negative vote weight.In order to qualify for seats based on the party-list vote share, a party must either win three single-member constituencies or exceed a threshold of 5% of the second votes nationwide. If a party only wins one or two single-member constituencies and fails to get at least 5% of the second votes, it keeps the single-member seat(s), but other parties that accomplish at least one of the two threshold conditions receive compensation seats. (In the most recent example of this, during the 2002 election, the PDS won only 4.0% of the party-list votes nationwide, but won two constituencies in the state of Berlin.) The same applies if an independent candidate wins a single-member constituency (which has not happened since 1949). In the 2013 election, the FDP only won 4.8% of party-list votes; this cost it all of its seats in the Bundestag.If a voter has cast a first vote for a successful independent candidate or a successful candidate whose party failed to qualify for proportional representation, their second vote does not count to determine proportional representation. However, it does count to determine whether the elected party has exceeded the 5% threshold.Parties representing recognized national minorities (currently Danes, Frisians, Sorbs and Romani people) are exempt from the 5% threshold, but normally only run in state elections.[5]"
    , "As with all haidomyrmecines members, the head structure of Linguamyrmex is interpreted to facilitate trap-jaw behavior, as is seen in modern specialized genera of Formicinae, Myrmicinae and Ponerinae. In haidomyrmecines the clypeus is modified to span from near the oral opening up past the mandibles to near the vertex of the head, the only ant group with such a modification. Along with the clypeal structuring a pair of long setae are positioned in the path of the mandibles. In modern trap-jaw ants such setae are used as triggers that initiate the rapid closure of the mandibles, often to capture prey or sometimes in a defensive action. The upper areas of the clypeus are always coated in a brush of stout setae in the region where the mandibles came to rest when triggered to close. Based on the modification of the clypeus, it is probable that Linguamyrmex would have captured prey from the front, other strategies being made improbable due to the upward motion of the mandibles. In haidomyrmecines with highly modified cleypeal areas, such as Linguamyrmex and Ceratomyrmex the horn probably served as a pinning or trapping point for the mandibles with captured prey.[1]This hypothesis for the purpose of the clypeus in Linguamyrmex is further supported by data obtained from X-ray micro-computed tomography scans of specimen \"BuPH-03\". Scanning of the specimen shows density variation in the paddle, with the outer edges less dense than the central core area on the paddles underside. This indicates the paddle was strengthened with thickened cuticle or with metals sequestering in the cuticle, the latter being more likely from the distinct contrast shown in the x-ray.[1] The location of the highest density is near the center of the paddle at the point of impact for the mandibles when they closed, likely to help brace the paddle against misfires of the mandibles, or impact through soft bodied prey, such as beetle larvae. Metals such as calcium, iron, manganese, and zinc are used by insects in both mandibles and ovipositors to reduce wear and increase durability.[1]"
    , "The complexity of real-time collaborative editing solutions stems from communication latency. In theory, if communication were instantaneous, then creating a real-time collaborative editor would be no more difficult than creating a single-user editor, because a document could be edited using an algorithm similar to the following:Request an 'edit document' token from the serverWait until the server says it's our turn to edit the document Tell the server how to edit the document Release the 'edit document' token However, the speed of communication is limited by network latency. This creates a fundamental dilemma: users need their own edits incorporated into the document instantly, but if they are incorporated instantly, then because of communication latency, their edits must necessarily be inserted into different versions of the document.An example illustrates this problem. Suppose Bob and Alice start with a document containing the word Mary. Bob deletes 'M', then inserts 'H', to change the word into Hary. Alice, before she receives either edit from Bob, deletes 'r', then deletes 'a', to change it into My. Both Bob and Alice will then receive edits that were applied to versions of the document that never existed on their own machines.Thus, the challenge of real-time collaborative editing is to figure out exactly how to apply edits from remote users, which were originally created in versions of the document that never existed locally, and which may conflict with the user's own local edits.The most sophisticated solutions solve this problem in a way that does not require a server, does not use locking (all users can freely edit all parts of a document at the same time), and supports any number of users (limited only by the resources of the computers). UNA and SubEthaEdit are examples of two programs that take this approach.While these sophisticated approaches enable the best user experience, a basic collaborative editor can also be created in a client–server model. In a client–server scenario, one of the editor instances is assigned the role of collaboration server when the document is opened. This server ensures that other editors are kept in sync by determining network latency and acting as a time synchronization server. The server receives timestamped notifications of changes made to the document by other users. It determines how those changes should affect its local copy, and broadcasts its changes to the collaboration pool. In some models, the changes are not reflected on a client until an official response is returned from the server, even if those changes were made locally.",
    , "James Robert McKee (born 1912 Charlotte, NC) was an American night club owner.McKee's parents died when he was fourteen forcing him to quit school and take care of his brothers and sisters. McKee married Minnie Jackson in 1939 and went to work as the head mail clerk with Horton Motor Lines. He also began tending bar at various restaurants around Charlotte, where he eventually got the idea to start the Excelsior Club, the first night club for African Americans in the Charlotte area.[1]In 1944 the first African American club became a reality when McKee bought a house on Beatties Ford Road. He renovated the house in new Art Moderne style complete with a dining and banquet room as well as a bar. The club became a favorite place for civil rights activists to meet during the 1950s and 1960s. The club hosted many famous musicians including Nat King Cole and local player Wilbert Harrison who started out at the Excelsior Club before rising to national fame.[2] The club became the leading private black social club in the Southeast and the largest one on the East Coast.[3]Community leader \"Genial Gene\" Potts, the WGIV radio host, made the club his informal base of operations.[1] A variety of men and women's social clubs also called the Excelsior home as well as African American fraternities and sororities.[4]After McKee started the club, he became a successful Charlotte business man, contributing to Johnson C Smith University, NAACP, Colored NC Police Association, Democratic Party and YMCA. McKee was awarded man of the year in 1957 by the Charlotte Post newspaper.McKee died from cancer on July 25, 1985 at the age of 72. Upon his death Ken Koontz made sure the club continued. Representative William \"Pete\" Cunningham purchased the Club becoming the sole owner of the Historic Excelsior Club in 1988-2006. He sold it in 2006 to Civil rights attorney James Ferguson and his family bought the club and continues to run and maintain it. As of May 2017 the wife of former Rep. Pete Cunningham, Carla Cunningham has become the sole proprietor. [5] The Club was designated as a historic property in 1986."];
